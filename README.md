It is a clone website of youtube.com. Technologies used in my project are -

• Data fetching from the youtube realtime API • All the video details with their title, views and duration • Config Driven UI • Realtime Comments • Shimmer UI for loading video pages • Search option to search any videos • Related Videos Suggestions

I've built this complete website using React JS, Redux - Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Tailwind
